## Stack

This is a learning project so, as simple as possible. My current goal is to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to explore their more recent features and see how far I can get by myself while trying to understand what problems are better resolved by frameworks.

The end goal is to host this application on a kubernetes cluster, again as a learning project.

## Features

Following is a list of features that I'd like to support with this web app:
- Fetch Wordnet trimmed data hosted on Github
- Randomly match adjectives with nouns on demand
- Render the descriptions on demand
- Check for domain availability on demand
- Local-first PWA
