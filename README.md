# wordnet-data

This repository contains a Node.js [script](./src/script.js) to fetch, expand, trim and store [Wordnet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) data files that can then be used by other projects.

For reference, the Wordnet data structure is documented [here](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/documentation/wndb5wn).

## Development

1. Make sure that Node.js is installed
2. Navigate to the [src](./src/) folder
2. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Make necessary adjustments

4. Use eslint to review the code

```bash
npx eslint ./script.js
```
